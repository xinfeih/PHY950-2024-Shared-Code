    "## What happens if your job crashes while you write a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "In case a program does not terminate in a clean way, the file directory may not be written at the end of the file. Next time this file is used, ROOT will automatically detect this abnormal termination and will recover the directory by scanning sequentially the list of keys in the file. If the file has been opened in UPDATE mode, the recovered directory will be automatically written to the file. This automatic recovery procedure is possible because of redundant information written to the file. In case you write large *TTrees*, you may have large buffers in memory. In case of a job crash, you may loose a lot of data. A mechanism is foreseen for this case as well. See *TTree::AutoSave*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Can a file being written by a *process* be read simultaneously by another *process*?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is thanks to the redundancies mentioned above that the ROOT file format allows to read a file which is being written by a separate process at the same time. This can be particularly important for online applications where a Data Acquisition System may be writing a large ROOT file which is \"spied\" by a separate monitoring process."
